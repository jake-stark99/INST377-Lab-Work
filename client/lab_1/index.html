<h2>A little about me</h2>
<p>My name is Jake Stark. I was born in Mt Kisco,
    NY but was raised in Connecticut. I have been here at the University of Maryland 
    since fall 2017. I am in my last semester and will be graduating in December. I tend to consider myself an
    easy going guy who likes to have fun but still get my work done. Somethings I hold dearest to my heart are my family, friends, and the New York Yankees.
If you ever would like to talk baseball just understand I <strong>will</strong> bring up our <strong><em>27 World Series titles.</em></strong></p>
